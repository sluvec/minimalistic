- Create, edit, and delete notes
- Add optional tags to notes (for easy filtering)
- Assign optional categories to notes (for organization)
- Filter notes by tags and categories
- Responsive and minimalist design
- Cross-device access through Supabase backend

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd minimalist-notes-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) if you don't have one already
2. Create a new Supabase project
3. In the Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (copy from `.env.example`) and add your Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Create Database Tables

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create notes table
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT, 
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  tags TEXT[] DEFAULT NULL,
  due_date DATE,
  url TEXT,
  priority TEXT,
  importance TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc', now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc', now())
);

-- Set up RLS (Row Level Security) policies
ALTER TABLE notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to allow users to select only their own notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own notes" ON notes 
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to allow users to insert their own notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can create notes" ON notes 
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to allow users to update their own notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own notes" ON notes 
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to allow users to delete their own notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own notes" ON notes 
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create index on user_id for better performance
CREATE INDEX notes_user_id_idx ON notes (user_id);
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations (Optional but Recommended)

Run the following migrations in your Supabase SQL editor for additional features:

**Add Archive Feature:**
```bash
# Run production_migration.sql in Supabase SQL editor
```

**Add Estimated Duration Fields:**
```bash
# Run add_estimated_duration_migration.sql in Supabase SQL editor
```

These migrations add:
- `archived` column for archiving notes
- `estimated_hours` and `estimated_minutes` columns for tracking estimated task duration

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).
